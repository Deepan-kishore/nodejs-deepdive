## Key Concepts Covered
- **Clustering**: Understanding how to scale Node.js applications using multiple processes.
- **Event Loop**: Deep dive into the phases of the event loop and asynchronous programming.
- **Streams**: Working with streams to handle data efficiently.
- **Buffers**: Managing binary data directly in Node.js.
